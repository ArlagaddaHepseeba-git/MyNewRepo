AWS, or Amazon Web Services, is a cloud computing platform that provides a wide range of IT services over the internet on a pay-as-you-go basis. Instead of buying and managing their own physical servers and data centers, companies can use AWS to access services like storage, computing power, and databases instantly. This allows businesses to save on upfront costs, scale their IT resources as needed, and innovate faster. 
How it works
On-demand IT services: AWS offers services such as storage, computing power, and databases that businesses can use through the internet.
Pay-as-you-go pricing: You pay only for the services you consume, which can be more cost-effective than owning and maintaining your own physical hardware.
Instant scaling: Businesses can instantly "spin up" hundreds or thousands of servers in minutes, rather than having to plan and procure them weeks or months in advance.
Global infrastructure: AWS has a vast global network of data centers, allowing companies to deploy their applications and services closer to their customers.
Broad and deep services: AWS offers a wide array of services, from basic computing and storage to more advanced machine learning and analytics tools, helping organizations build anything they can imagine.
